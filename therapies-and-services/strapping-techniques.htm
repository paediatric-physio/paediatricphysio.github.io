                    <h1>Strapping and taping techniques</h1>
                    <p>There is a wide range of pressure garments, taping and strapping techniques available to enhance postural alignment and stability. I have experience with most of them and I am able to trial, fit or prescribe most of the available options.
</p>
                    <h2>Kinesio Taping</h2>
                    <p>The Kinesio Taping &reg; method is a taping technique designed to facilitate the body's natural healing process while providing support and stability to muscles and joints. It provides extended soft tissue manipulation to prolong the benefits of therapy. Kinesio tape is Latex-free and wearable for up to four days at a time.</p>
                    <p>I have participated in an extended paediatric Kinesio Taping course and have used it with many of my clients since. It can be an efficient addition to therapy to gently enhance postural uprightness and alignment. </p>
    <p>If the taping is helpful I often teach the parents or carers how to tape their child correctly so they can continue taping at home. We will discuss the frequency of the application and the rest times for the child’s skin to recover.
</p>
                    <h2>TheraTogs</h2>
                    <p>TheraTogs are orthotic garment systems designed to provide gentle, prolonged muscle stretch and alignment guidance that replicates the physiotherapists manual positioning. The client gains postural support and corrected functional alignment throughout the day. TheraTogs are worn under clothes as “body training underwear”.
</p>
                    <p>There are several suits available, all of which are made of a foam interior with a Velcro sensitive exterior. A variety of Velcro pieces and stretchy straps are then added to provide gentle forces to the body to correct and improve individual posture and alignment.</p>
                    <p>Every TheraTogs garment has to be fitted and adjusted to the needs of the child by a physiotherapist. I am an accredited TheraTogs fitter so I am able to source trial kits, adjust and fit the garment for your child. If we decide that the garment is helpful to support your goals, I can facilitate funding for the garment.</p>
                    <p>Once it arrives I will custom fit the garment and strappings for the child and teach parents and carers how to put it on and how to position the straps. We will also discuss optimal times for use.</p>
                    <h2>SPIO </h2>
                    <p>SPIO (Stabilizing Pressure Input Orthosis) is a garment used to provide sensory input to help children with a variety of conditions improving their trunk tone, posture and function. The SPIO Vest is made of thin Lycra® with a Neoprene back and can be worn under clothing. The vest is fitted to the child by strapping Velcros over the back, shoulders and crotch.</p>
                    <h2>DMO Suit</h2>
                    <p>The DMO suit is designed to align the shoulders, trunk and hips. It improves symmetry and assists stabilisation of the body and spine.</p>
<p>The DMO suit is constructed from two forms of strategically placed Lycra &reg; paneling. This enables the suit to provide support to aid proximal stability and to positively affect muscle tone.</p>
<p>The DMO suit has to be measured and custom made in the UK. There are clinics in different locations in Australia for measurement and fitting. I can provide input into the making of the suits to help achieve the best possible outcome but as it is custom fabricated it is not possibility to trial the suit before ordering it.
